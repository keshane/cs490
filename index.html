    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>Coordinating lessons between students and teachers is a tricky job, especially for numerous students and multiple teachers. In an organization that I'm in, one to three people usually spend hours trying to schedule these lessons. In addition to finding times that both the teacher and student can meet, they must also consider the relative seniorities of the teacher and student, the past experience of the student, and existing relationships among other constraints. My goal was to perform this task automatically and as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>This problem is similar to other optimization problems in the literature, but it has subtleties that warranted deeper investigation. The core of the project is an assignment problem and an interval scheduling problem. However, some facets of this problem could not fit neatly into the mold of the aforementioned problems. By adding to and modifying the existing methods that individually solve the assignment and interval scheduling problem, we are able to create a system dedicated to solving the whole problem. The key was to implement a working solution for the intended inputs, and then to modify it for our special inputs and parameters.</p>
    <p>For the intended users of the results of this project, it will be a wonderful addition to their routine. The results are correct and fast, but only due to the relaxed parameters of this specific case.</p>
    <p>The solution to this particular problem lacks an exact, neat answer. However, there is promise that, while not exact, this solution can be expanded to more general problems of this type that require schedules to be made.</p>
